# Node.js Unit Testing In-Depth
â€‹A focused,  Node.js unit testing, from absolute beginner to very advanced.

I will post my progress during the course here.


## Packages I use :

## Intro
This is a quick example project to show how a test environment can be setup in Node.js

It includes the following

- [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) - *testing framework*
- [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) - *assertion library*
- [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) - *coverage testing*
- [SinonJs](http://sinonjs.org/) - *stubs and splices for mocking data*



## The Project
In this project, it is a small study that I created on the information I obtained from the sources in order to improve myself.

## To Install
- Navigate into your working directory, run the following commands:
- ```git clone https://github.com/nuri35/node-js-unit-testing.git``` to clone repo
- ```cd node-js-unit-testing.git``` to navigate into project
- ```npm install``` to install the dependencies

## To run the project

- ```npm test``` will run the Mocha tests, output results and generate reports
- ```npm run cover``` will run the Istanbul coverage tests and output results and generate reports

## Screenshots

Command Line Output: Tests Passing
